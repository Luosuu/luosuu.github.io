## About Me

Greetings! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Geoffrey Fox](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/geoffrey-c-fox). I also work closely with [Prof. Keren Zhou](https://www.jokeren.tech/).

Before UVA, I received my B.Eng in CS and B.Sc in Applied Mathematics at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2022.

I was a Research Intern at [Systems & Networking Research Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-and-networking-research-group-asia/).

I also did an exchange-study in Japan for one year during my undergrad at [The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/) where I was supervised by [Prof. Yoichi Haneda](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/research/introduction/opal-ring/0006341.html) at [UEC Sound Media Lab](http://www.hanedalab.inf.uec.ac.jp/).

## Research Interests

- **Systems for ML:** data management for ML, distributed ML systems, HPC for ML
- **System-ML Co-design:** new ML paradigms efficient with hardware

## News

- **[Apr. 2024]** I will present at AIOps workshop of ASPLOS 2024 in San Diego!

## Misc.

Actually you can write (or pronounce) my name in many different ways besides "Tianle Zhong":

* 钟天乐 (My legal name in Simplified Chinese)

* 鐘天樂 (Traditional Chinese)

* Shou, Tenraku (Japanese Kanji pronunciation)

* Chung, Tin-lok (Wade-Giles romanization)

Another fun fact: 

I have the exact same first name with one of my favorite actors [Louis Koo Tin-lok, 古天樂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Koo).


My work heavily relies on Python and Rust. I release my code as much as possible on GitHub. 

I got these lovely logos from [SAWARATSUKI/ServiceLogos](https://github.com/SAWARATSUKI/ServiceLogos).
